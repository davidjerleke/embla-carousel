# CDN

Start by including the Embla Carousel script from a CDN with a `script` tag:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={cdnInstallation_cdn_01} />

## The HTML structure

A recommended setup uses an **overflow wrapper** and a **scroll container**, though the outer wrapper is optional. The element with the class name `embla__viewport` serves as both the root and the overflow wrapper. To avoid drag conflicts, place navigation buttons outside the viewport. Start by adding the following **HTML** structure to your carousel:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={theHtmlStructure_01} />

## Styling the carousel

The element with the classname `embla__viewport` acts as an overflow wrapper, ensuring that any scroll overflow is hidden. The element with the classname `embla__container` is the scrollable area that holds and moves the slides. Add the following **CSS** to style these elements:

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={stylingTheCarousel_01} />

## Accessing the carousel API

Select the element with the classname `embla__viewport` and pass it as the first argument to the `EmblaCarousel` constructor. This will **initialize** your carousel and provide full **access** to the Embla Carousel [API](/api/).

<PrismHighlight
  language="html"
  code={accessingTheCarouselApi_01}
  highlight="7"
/>

## Adding plugins

Plugins let you **extend your carousel** with additional features beyond the built-in core functionality. To get started, install the plugin you want to use. In this example, we'll add the [Autoplay](/plugins/autoplay/) plugin:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={addingPlugins_01} highlight="2" />

<Admonition type="note">
  **Note:** Plugins loaded from a CDN will be **prefixed** with `EmblaCarousel`.
  For example, the full plugin name becomes
  `EmblaCarousel<PluginNameInPascalCase>`, and the Autoplay plugin specifically is
  `EmblaCarouselAutoplay`.
</Admonition>

You can pass an **optional plugin array** as the third argument when initializing Embla Carousel. Here's how to extend the carousel from the previous example with Autoplay:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={addingPlugins_02} highlight="8,14" />

Congratulations! You just created your first Embla Carousel.
