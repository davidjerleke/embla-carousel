# Slide Gaps

This guide shows you how to add **spacing between slides** in Embla Carousel.

All examples use the **padding approach** to create gaps between slides. Although you can also use other CSS techniques like `margin` or `gap` on the container, this guide will explain **why padding is often easier to work with**, with minimal hassle compared to its alternatives.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with this guide, make sure you've completed the following:

- [How Embla Carousel Works](/guides/how-embla-carousel-works)
- [Required Setup](/guides/required-setup)
- [Slide Sizes](/guides/slide-sizes)

## Understanding gaps

The recommended way to create spacing between slides is to use **padding on the slides themselves** combined with a corresponding **negative margin on the container**.

To make padding predictable and included in the element's width (so it doesn't add extra size), you should apply `box-sizing: border-box` globally, which is standard practice on most sites (and often included in `reset.css` or similar):

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={understandingGaps_01} />

## Setting gaps

With `box-sizing: border-box` in place, you can adjust the `--slide-spacing:` variable in your CSS to change slide gap sizes:

<ExamplesLazy
  loader={() =>
    import('components/Examples/Guides/SlideGaps/SlideGapsInteractive')
  }
  wrapper={EXAMPLES_WRAPPERS.TWO_FORM_ROWS}
/>

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={settingGaps_01} highlight="3,13,19" />

The **benefits** of the **padding approach** include:

- **Keeps spacing consistent:** If slide sizes change, the gaps remain correct and the carousel continues to work as expected.
- **Automatic updates:** Embla uses `ResizeObserver` to track slide sizes, so changes to gap sizes are picked up automatically because the padding is included in the slide size.
- **Supports variable-width slides:** Each slide can have a different width, and the spacing still works without additional configuration.
- **RTL-friendly:** The approach works even if the carousel is flipped to right-to-left, without any modifications.
- **Compatible with Embla SSR feature:** This method works when Embla is configured with server-side rendering, helping to avoid layout shifts for looped carousels and other scenarios.

## Breakpoints

To make **slide gaps responsive** with the **padding approach**, use CSS **media queries**.

Because Embla relies on a `ResizeObserver` to track each slide's **computed dimensions**, it automatically recalculates scroll snaps whenever a slide's size changes. Since the padding is included in each slide's computed size, any gap adjustments made via media queries are detected automatically — no extra code required.

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={breakpoints_01} highlight="4,21,25" />

## Other methods

If you still prefer **not to use the padding approach**, there are a few things to be aware of.
Embla will work with other CSS techniques such as `gap` or `margin`, but the trade-offs stem from how **CSS spacing properties behave**, not from any limitation in Embla itself.

### Gap or margin

<Admonition type="warning">
  **Warning:** When using `margin` or `gap`, it's important to get your CSS
  calculations right, because these properties **add to the total slide size**.
</Admonition>

For example, to achieve **two slides per view** with a `gap` or `margin` of `20px` between each slide, you need to account for the extra space added by these properties:

- Slide 1: `50% + 20px`
- Slide 2: `50% + 20px`
- **Total:** `100% + 40px` → exceeds the viewport

Embla reads the **computed slide dimensions**, so scroll snaps are based on these expanded sizes. To achieve an exact fit, you need to adjust the `flex-basis` or use `calc()`:

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={gapOrMargin_01} />

If slide sizes change dynamically, you must also remember to update the **margin** or **gap** values, which can create maintenance overhead.

<Admonition type="warning">
  **Warning:** Unlike padding, changes in `margin` or `gap` **do not affect the slide's computed size**, so Embla's `ResizeObserver` **won't detect them automatically**. If you update the gap or margin dynamically (e.g., via media queries or JavaScript), you must manually call:

<br />

<PrismHighlight language="js" code={gapOrMargin_02} />

</Admonition>

### Gap with loop enabled

When using **gap** and **loop: true**, there **won't be a gap between the last and first slide**.
This happens because **Embla only reads the computed distances between slides**, and CSS **gap** only adds spacing **between items**, not before the first or after the last.

A simple workaround is to add a **margin** to the last slide:

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={gapWithLoopEnabled} />

### Caveats

- **Margins** and **gaps** add to slide width, which can **easily break layouts** if not accounted for.
- Requires **manual math adjustments** (often with `calc()`) for precise alignment.
- More **error-prone** for **responsive** or **variable-width** carousels unless all slide sizes and spacing are carefully calculated.
- **Gap** will not apply between the first and last slide in **loop: true** unless additional **margin** is added.

While both **gap** and **margin** can work, **padding on slides combined with a negative margin on the container** remains the most **robust, predictable, and maintenance-friendly approach**, which supports **looped**, **responsive**, and **SSR-enabled** carousels without the need for additional modifications.
