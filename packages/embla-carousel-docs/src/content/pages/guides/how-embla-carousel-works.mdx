# How Embla Carousel Works

Embla Carousel uses **minimal DOM manipulation** to deliver smooth, high-performance scrolling.

---

## Minimal DOM manipulation

Embla changes the DOM in only two ways:

- **Carousel container** - applies `translate3d` to create the scroll effect.
- **Carousel slides** - applies `translate3d` to adjust slide positions (for looping) and improve scroll performance.

You can see this in action by inspecting the following example in your browser's developer tools:

<ExamplesLazy
  loader={() =>
    import(
      'components/Examples/Guides/HowEmblaCarouselWorks/MinimalDomManipulation'
    )
  }
/>

The container receives an inline `transform`:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={minimalDomManipulation_01} />

And slides may also receive inline `transform` styles:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={minimalDomManipulation_02} />

That's it — nothing else is added to the DOM. **Embla does not encapsulate or wrap any elements**, so you retain full control over your markup, structure, and styling. This behavior applies to the core library as well as the official framework wrappers. Plugins, however, **may modify the DOM further**, so check individual [plugin pages](/plugins) for details.

## Notes

Before adding custom styles, remember how **Embla manipulates the DOM** — applying styles incorrectly can break its functionality.

<Admonition type="warning">
  **Warning:** Do **not** apply custom **`transform`** or **`transition`**
  styles directly to the **carousel container** or **slides**. Embla applies
  transforms via inline styles and animates them using a spring-based system
  with `requestAnimationFrame`; adding your own will conflict and **break the
  carousel's behavior**.
</Admonition>

Instead, apply transforms/transitions to a **wrapper element** around the carousel:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={notes_01} />

When applying transforms/transitions to slides, create an **inner element** within each slide:

<PrismHighlight language="html" code={notes_02} />

This approach keeps Embla's animations intact while giving you full flexibility to style and animate around them.
