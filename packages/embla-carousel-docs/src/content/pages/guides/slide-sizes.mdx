# Slide Sizes

This guide shows you how to control and customize the sizes of your slides in Embla Carousel.

All examples use **flexbox** to size and align slides, but you can use any layout method (flexbox, grid, or other CSS techniques). The only requirement is that your slides stack along the carousel's scroll axis — **horizontally** for a horizontal carousel, or **vertically** for a vertical carousel.

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with this guide, make sure you've completed the following:

- [How Embla Carousel Works](/guides/how-embla-carousel-works)
- [Required Setup](/guides/required-setup)

## Understanding sizes

Embla Carousel doesn't assign slide sizes itself. Instead, it **measures the computed dimensions of your slides** — the final sizes that result from your CSS — and uses those values to calculate scrolling.

The beauty of this approach is that you can define **any slide sizes you want**, mix sizes for variable-size slides, and use **any unit you prefer**. This applies to both horizontal and vertical carousels.

## Setting sizes

You can adjust the `--slide-size` variable in your CSS to change slide sizes:

<ExamplesLazy
  loader={() =>
    import('components/Examples/Guides/SlideSizes/SlideSizesInteractive')
  }
  wrapper={EXAMPLES_WRAPPERS.ONE_FORM_ROW}
/>

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={slideSizes_01} highlight="2,15" />

## Breakpoints

To make **slide sizes responsive**, simply use CSS **media queries**. Embla uses a `ResizeObserver` under the hood, so whenever a slide's **computed dimensions** change, the carousel will automatically recalculate the scroll snaps.

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={breakpoints_01} highlight="3,13" />

## Variable widths

To create slides with **variable widths**, set different sizes for each slide using CSS. Embla will measure the computed sizes and adjust the scrolling automatically.

<ExamplesLazy
  loader={() =>
    import('components/Examples/Guides/SlideSizes/SlideSizesVariableWidths')
  }
/>

<PrismHighlight language="css" code={variableWidths_01} />

## Notes

- You are in full control of slide sizes via CSS. Adjust widths, heights, or layout methods to achieve the layout you want.
- Slides must stack along the carousel's scroll axis — horizontally for horizontal carousels, vertically for vertical ones.

<Admonition type="warning">
  **Warning:** Embla may work if you define slide sizes larger than the viewport
  (greater than 100%), but this is **not officially supported** and could lead
  to unexpected behavior. Use with caution.
