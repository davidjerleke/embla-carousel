# Slide Gaps

Embla Carousel allows you to use **any CSS to stack your slides** in the chosen scroll [axis](/api/options/#axis), whether it's CSS Grid, flexbox, inline-blocks or anything else. It will conveniently **pick up any spacings** between the slides and **automatically adjust the scroll snaps** accordingly.

## Declaring gaps

It's recommended to declare gaps between slides **using CSS**. Any CSS that will render space between the slides is valid. You may add spacing in one direction like so:

```css
.embla__slide {
  margin-right: 20px;
}
```

It's also valid to add gaps in both directions:

```css
.embla__slide {
  margin-right: 20px;
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

If you're using CSS Grid you can declare your gaps like so:

```css
.embla__container {
  grid-column-gap: 20px;
}
```

> **Note!** If you don't have [loop](/api/options/#loop) enabled, Embla Carousel will ignore any gaps at the start and end edge of the carousel.

## Variable gaps

Just like [variable](/guides/slide-sizes/#variable-sizes) slide sizes, variable gap sizes is **supported out of the box**. Declare your gap sizes in your CSS to achieve this:

```css
.embla__slide:nth-child(1) {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
.embla__slide:nth-child(2) {
  margin-right: 20px;
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

## Responding to breakpoints

Embla Carousel will **automatically pick up** any **changes in gap sizes** when the **window is resized**. It's very simple to set different sizes based on your breakpoints:

```css
.embla__slide {
  margin-right: 10px; /* Default slide gap */
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .embla__slide {
    margin-right: 20px; /* Breakpoint SM gap */
  }
}
```
